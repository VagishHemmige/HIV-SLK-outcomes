The goal of `HIV SLK outcomes` is to compared the outcomes of people living with HIV (PLWH) who have undergone simultaneous liver-kidney transplant to controls without HIV using the [Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients](https://srtr.transplant.hrsa.gov/) database.

The full analysis with R code is available at [https://vagishhemmige.github.io/HIV-SLK-outcomes/](https://vagishhemmige.github.io/HIV-SLK-outcomes/).

These data have been presented at the NY-NJ Center for AIDS Research 2026 regional conference as a poster.
