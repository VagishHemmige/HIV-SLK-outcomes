### Reproducibility

All analyses presented on this website are fully reproducible.  

The complete source code used to perform the full analysis and generate the tables and figures is publicly available at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/VagishHemmige/HIV-SLK-outcomes).  The R script `R/main.R` will run the R subscripts needed for this analysis in the order they are to be run.  Model assumptions, parameter values, and analytic workflows are documented in the repository to facilitate transparency and reuse.


## Abstracts/manuscripts

This analysis has yet to be published to date.  However, preliminary results have been presented at the NY-NJ Center for AIDS Research 
2026 regional conference as a poster.
